1. What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not?
    a. I believe that everything has been correctly implemented except for the distance calculations. There are some cases where it comes up as undefined and 
    I wasn't able to figure out how to fix that. Everything displays correctly, it's just that sometimes what comes up in the display is undefined rather than 
    a value.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
    a. I only discussed the assignment during office hours with the TAs.

3. Approximately how long did you spend on this project?
    a. 6-10 hours.
