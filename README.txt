1. What is the purpose of this Git repository?

My git repository is used to keep track of the work that I have done 
over the course of this semester in COMP-20. Storing all my work in this
repository will allow me to go back at any time to look at my work, which
will all be located in one space. 


2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment that we completed this semester was assignment #3.
This assignment dealt with the server-side of web programming. It exposed me
to tools such as heroku, node.js with the express framework, and mongodb. When 
I first read over the assignment, I was a bit apprehensive because I thought 
it was going to be rather challenging. And although it was challenging, I enjoyed
the process of coding and testing and then trying to figure out where I was going 
wrong. This was the point in the semester where I truly felt things begin to click,
and this was the assignment that I felt the most confident in. 


3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

When I look at the work that I was submitting at the beginning of this course
and compare it to the work that I am doing now, not only with the most recent 
assignments, but also with the final project, the growth is really apparent. I 
feel like this course has really allowed me to gain knowledge across a wide variety
of areas. I now have knowledge on front-end coding as well as server-side coding
and have also gained some basic security knowledge. 


4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing that I learned this semester is the importance of styling 
a website. I believe that I really gravitated to this area because I am a human factors
major so I learn a lot about the importance of a good interface, which styling has a lot 
to do with. The importance of this truly came through right at the beginning with the first assignment
when we were asked to create a portfolio and needed to style it to make the site look appealing.
The difference in the site prior to being styled compared to the site after being styled was
rather drastic and I felt truly made a difference in the experience when visiting the site. 
The importance of this also has come up a lot through my work on the final project. In this 
case we have been relying on a CSS framework, namely bulma, but implementing this framework
has, once again, completely changed the experience of visiting our website. 


5. Now that you have finished this course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

After completing this course I want to move into working more on the front-end of web programming
and dealing with the styling of websites to improve the interaction between the user and the 
interface. I hope to explore classes such as COMP 86 in order to help me dive
deeper into this topic.
