1. Aspects of the work correctly and incorrectly implemented.
    a. It seems that everything is correctly implemented. I annotated the video by line. I am not sure if there was a preference as to whether the annotations should
    be above or below the video, but I placed them above.

    b. I did not discuss this assignment with anyone aside from attending office hours for some questions that I had.
